This project explores a classification problem using a machine learning model, possibly a deep learning model implemented with Keras. To prevent overfitting during training, early stopping was employed. The model's performance was evaluated using a confusion matrix, providing insights into its predictive accuracy for each class. The confusion matrix was visualized for a clearer understanding of the model's strengths and weaknesses. Customization options, such as adjusting the figure size and displaying percentages, were utilized to enhance the visualization.
